# Breakdown

Hi! Welcome to Breakdown. This is a little project of mine that will hopefully become a TTRPG
campaign someday. It is inspired mostly be eldritch folk horror like the video game [Dredge] by
Black Salt Games, the book [The Fisherman] by John Langan, as well as the New Weird books of [Jeff
Vandermeer]. This is further explained in the [Inspirations](/inspirations/main.md) section.

Breakdown also draws heavily on the philosophical ideas of [Existentialism]; in
particular, ideas from Sartre, Dostoyevsky, and Nietzsche are common. This is explained further in
the [Themes](/themes/main.md) section. These ideas are where Breakdown gets its name; what happens
when you are forced to exit the world of the known and enter a space where determinism begins to
literally break down?
