# Serapis

Serapis is an unremarkable mining colony on the edge of the [Imperium](../imperium/main.md). It is
also your home and, to your knowledge, the last bastion of human civilization in the galaxy.

## Climate

The climate of Serapis is predominantly [savanna] with desert extending through the tropics and some
temperate rainforests around the poles. Most of the inhabited areas of the planet lay in this band
of savanna and up through the poles as the deserts are often far too warm for extended human
habitation. During terraforming, the axial tilt of the planet was adjusted so that the savannas
receive all four seasons. This stands in contrast to many of the savannas on Earth which have a
rainy and dry season due to being situated closer to the equator.

### Temperature

Temperatures can range between 30째C and 14째C during the summer months and 17째C and 3째C in the winter
months. This large range of temperatures means that Serapis has flora and fauna which are adapted
for both warm and cold weather.

### Weather

The weather on Serapis is pretty temperamental depending on the season; during the winter months,
the savannas get huge thunderstorms with lots of rain. However, in the summer months, the savannas
get relatively little rain, corresponding to dry seasons on Earth. Serapis is almost always sunny
with the only break in this behavior occurring during winter thunderstorms.

## Wildlife

### Savanna

The savanna wildlife of Serapis represents a relatively similar ecosystem to what one might find in
the [Serengeti National Park]. This means that apex predators are typically feline-like creatures
similar to lions as well as larger packs of dog-like animals similar to African wild dog. There is
also abundant food for these animals in the form of stand-ins for wildebeest, gazelle, eland, and
buffalo.

Due to being a savanna, there are sparse trees which do not form a canopy as well as shrubs and
grasses beneath them.
