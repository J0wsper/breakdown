# Symbols

Each of the [three themes](/themes/main.md#themes) of Breakdown have their own associated symbols
throughout the campaign. This helps to give a visual shorthand to the players like all good symbols
should do, as well as highlighting connections that were previously difficult to interpret. One of
my favorite uses of symbols is by John Langan in the Fisherman where he uses water as a symbol for
grief and fishing as a way of interacting with that grief. In this way, the characters dredge up
their grief, preventing their wounds from healing.
