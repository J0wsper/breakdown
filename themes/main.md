# Themes

Breakdown has a few key themes:

- How we know things about our world, also known as [epistemology](#epistemology).
  - In particular, the role of [communication](#communication) and how the collective experience
    influences what we think we know.
- [Ontology](#ontology), the nature of being, and the endless struggle of finding one's place in the
  universe.
  - Like with epistemology, ontology is also influenced heavily by how we are [perceived by others
    ](#communication).
- A huge inspiration for Breakdown is [No Exit] by Jean-Paul Sartre. This play primarily tackles
  themes of ontology through the eyes of others. It does not deal with ideas of epistemology. In
  general, Breakdown is inspired by the philosophical movement of existentialism, headed by
  individuals like Sartre, Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, and Kafka.

<!-- TODO: Maybe remove this? I prefer the ontology theme. -->

## Epistemology

[Epistemology] is the study of how we know things. It is also called the theory of knowledge. It is a
philosophical area of huge import, and there are many different schools of thought on how we know
things. For instance, skeptics think that we cannot know anything about our world. This idea dates
back to the time of Descartes but is still relatively popular today. Personally, I am not a skeptic
but Breakdown places the players into a situation where they might be forced to confront such
issues.

In the context of Breakdown, epistemology is relevant because after the arrival of the black ship on
[Serapis](/setting/serapis/main.md), the known begins to become less and less concrete. In fact, all
of the assumptions we made about the universe are questioned: space, time, and many other facets of
the natural world start to behave in ways we don't expect. This is also a hallmark of eldritch
horror: how do you deal with glimpsing a darker reality that you can no longer ignore?

## Ontology

Ontology is the study of being. Related to [communication](#communication), Breakdown primarily
examines [social ontology], defined by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as "the study of the
nature and properties of the social world." Due to the vastness of the
[Imperium](/setting/imperium/main.md), Breakdown analyzes social ontology because many family
members, friends and acquaintances of the inhabitants of Serapis are off-world, meaning the gaze of
these people has been lifted. How do you live now that a lot of the people you knew are no longer
around? Does your life change at all? Does it not change a bit?

This is perhaps highly relevant for the players because many of them are felons or criminals. What
do they do now that their crimes may no longer follow them? If they are from off-world (which some
of them likely are), how do you tackle with the fact that your home may no longer exist? What does
that do to your sense of self? What if you are now the only living legacy from your home world?

Many interesting questions arise in the setting of Breakdown, most of which are tied to
[communication](#communication).

## Communication

Communication is kind of tied up with both [epistemology](#epistemology) and [ontology](#ontology).
The theme of communication lays at the core of Breakdown: how does the presence of others influence
our perception of the world, as well as ourselves? What are the impacts of
[Luxor](/setting/serapis/luxor/main.md) being pretty much on its own? Furthermore, once the players
step outside of the city's walls and they only have each other for company, how does that impact
them?
