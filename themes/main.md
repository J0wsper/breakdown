# What are the Themes of Breakdown?

Breakdown has a few key themes:

- How we know things about our world, also known as [epistemology](##Epistemology).
  - In particular, the role of [communication](#communication) and how the collective experience
    influences what we think we know.
- [Ontology](##Ontology), the nature of being, and the endless struggle of finding one's place in
  the universe.
  - Like with epistemology, ontology is also influenced heavily by how we are [perceived by others
    ](#communication).
- A huge inspiration for this whole thing is [No Exit] by Jean-Paul Sartre. This play primarily
  tackles themes of ontology through the eyes of others, not really tackling any ideas of
  epistemology.

## Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of how we know things. It is also called the theory of knowledge. It is a
philosophical area of huge import, and there are many different schools of thought on how we know
things. For instance, skeptics think that we cannot know anything about our world. This idea dates
back to the thinking of Descartes.

In the context of Breakdown, this is relevant because after the arrival of the ship on Serapis, the
known begins to become less and less concrete. In fact, all of the assumptions we made about the
nature of the universe are questioned: space, time, and almost everything in the natural world start
to behave in ways we don't expect. This is a hallmark of eldritch horror; how do you deal with
glimpsing a darker reality that you can no longer ignore?

## Ontology

Ontology is the study of being.

## Communication
