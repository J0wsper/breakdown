# My Random Thoughts

## Themes

- Isolation is a tough theme to actually get right in a TTRPG setting. The players need to interact
  with the characters in-universe to push the story along and so you can't really just have them doing
  a constant dark-night-of-the-soul-style internal monologue like in a book.
- I think that self-deception is maybe a good theme. If you could make it that the players have all
  been lying to themselves due to societal pressures and now they're free, what would they do?
  - From that, you could make the BBEG some sort of fractured entity like the Empress in the
    Imperial Radch trilogy.
  - The BBEG is having inner turmoil and so has split into literally multiple different people.
  - This could fit with René being the messenger between the two halves (or maybe even more pieces)
    of this fractured entity.
- The role of the other in the perpetuation of self-deception? The players are now isolated from all
  of the people who they might have wronged in the past so what do they do? Do they become more
  authentically themselves? Or do they fall further into their self-constructed prison?
  - I think this could be some good stuff.
  - Still problematic because it's hard to integrate a character's backstory into the campaign
    without also somehow ruining the theme.
  - René can be the thing that teases out their backstories maybe.

## Wishlist

- 48, the unnamed soldier.
- Strange alien ruins and impossible geometry.
- Four-dimensional fuckery within the ruins and with René.
- Nightclub type scene.
- Teleportation/time travel between locations from the players' past.
- Wide open spaces where the players cannot help but feel that they're being watched.
- Creatures and people being corrupted by the presence of the black ship.
- René.
- Sudden silences as the world seems to stand still.
- Statues that seem to whisper and exert a gravity on the mind.
- Dungeon crawling into strange spaces that seemingly spawn out of nowhere.
- Never-ending day time.
- The Sun as the watchful eye.

## Systems

- Trophy Gold
- Into the Odd
- The Vast in the Dark (perhaps for the black ships?)
- Mothership
